# Green-Lab---Assignment-3

The 'code' folder contains all code used for producing the results as in our Overleaf document (link: https://www.overleaf.com/read/sbbzpvmrqjtm)

The 'results' folder contains all said results in the form of histograms, QQplots and violin plots. The tables that can be seen in our hypothesis 
section in our Overleaf document are manually constructed with a table generator, so they cannot be produced in the exact same form as in 
our document. But all values in the table can be produced with the code in the 'code' folder.
