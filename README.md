# Green-Lab---Assignment-3

The 'code' folder contains all code used for producing the results as in our Overleaf document (link: https://www.overleaf.com/read/sbbzpvmrqjtm)

The 'results' folder contains all said results in the form of histograms, QQplots and violin plots. The tables that can be seen in our 
hypothesis section in our Overleaf document are manually constructed with a table generator, so they cannot be produced in the exact 
same form as in our document. But all values in the table can be produced with the code in the 'code' folder.
